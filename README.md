## Setup

You need to provide your kaggle credentials to `kagglehub`.

1. Define environment variables `KAGGLE_USERNAME` and `KAGGLE_KEY`.
2. Or use a `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` file

If you are working in a devcontainer, you can use a `.devcontainer/kaggle.env` file to define the kaggle environment variables.

```sh
$ echo $KAGGLE_USERNAME
# your username
```
